# tbot

## Functions
-Maybe I Will write them someday (sorry)
-Probably shitty code (sorry for that too, i'm still only learning!)

## Installation
`git clone`  
`npm install`  
`cp config-example.js config.js`  
You would need google private key for voice recognition and tts support  
`echo GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/location/to/google-credentials.json" > .env`  

`node index.js`  

## That should do the trick
